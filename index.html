                <p class="uno">Flash SAT is an interactive card game, 
                    designed to learn fast and easy. Flash SAT is a really nice tool to prepare for the SAT,
                     as we have a wide range of areas including desmos, 
                     because as most of you might know the new virtual SAT implements this virtual calculator,
                      and it might be useful to know how to use it. To play, just click on one of the cards, in the section play,
                       and start your journey through the page, for more insights watch the video. </p>

                <p class="dos">Flash SAT is a web originally created for a computer science class, 
                    in Genuine school. Although its beginning seems a little forced, the idea 
                    of flash cards helping in the SAT where an idea the creator had planned to 
                    develop, although it was not originally thought to be a web-page, the technology 
                    class opened new possibilities for the idea. </p>

                <p class="tres">Although Flash SAT is a great tool, as you might already notice, the range 
                    of possibilities in the game itself is limited, as the development team was conformed 
                    by solidly one person, uploading and analysing ideas for the cards in each section 
                    was a slow process, and more when there were just two hands working on it. This whole 
                    “help” section has the purpose to invite all those people willing to make flash SAT 
                    a better site, whether you know html and css or just want to help. </p>
